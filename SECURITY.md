# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally focus on the latest released version. If you encounter a security issue, please report it as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

- Open a private report by creating a new GitHub issue and marking it clearly as a security concern, or contact the maintainer privately if you prefer.
- Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the impact (version, environment, minimal proof-of-concept, etc.).
- We will review your report and work on a fix. Once a resolution is available, we will release an update and may credit you in the changelog if you wish.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and ask you to avoid sharing details publicly until a fix has been released.
